# standard-commits

[_The Standard Commits format is a structured approach to writing commit messages that enhance clarity and consistency in version control systems. This format is particularly beneficial for projects with multiple contributors, as it provides a common language for describing changes._](https://github.com/standard-commits/standard-commits)

## Motivation?

[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). I have been previously experimenting with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and it somehow was helpful for wrapping some initial functionality. Haskell is in-fact large language and I skipped some content there and there, my objective is to position myself in functional programming by finishing simple project (as is this parser de-facto) and introspect which concepts are known and which seemd to be trouble.

## TODOs

- [ ] Deduplicate vaguely written logic into pure functions (explore haskell possibilities)
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Compilation and distribution research
- [ ] Simple expressions
- [ ] [Parser Combinators](https://github.com/lettier/parsing-with-haskell-parser-combinators)
- [ ]  [Parsing (PLTDI Wiki)](https://pltdi.miraheze.org/wiki/Parsing)
