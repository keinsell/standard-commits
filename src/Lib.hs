data Importance

  | -- | `!` (exclamation) Changes something exposed externally, and MAY break projects that depend on the underlying repository.
    Breaking
  | -- | `!!` (loud exclamation) This change is critical â”€ previous versions have severe issues that must be addressed. Projects depending on the underlying repository SHOULD update immediately. The <footer> MUST specify the last safe commit (Last-safe-commit).
